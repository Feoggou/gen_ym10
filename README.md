A useless dll. It's a plugin for winamp used to change the Yahoo! Messenger status. requires Yahoo! Messenger 10 minimum.
It can do nifty tricks like making the messenger display & change status to show the lyrics of a melody as it's being played (provided the lyrics have been set for each timestamp).
But since on Yahoo! Messenger there are not lots of people staring only to the status messages of others, this app is kind of useless.

Initially it was a MFC application, but later switched to pure API.

I began this application somewhere between 2007-2010, but with the arrival of Yahoo! Messenger 10 I could find out the user name logged in, so I finished it in 2010.
The app is obviously not being maintained.
